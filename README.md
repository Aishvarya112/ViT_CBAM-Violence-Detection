# ViT_CBAM-Violence-Detection

A lightweight spatiotemporal transformer-based violence detection method that integrates ViT with aConvolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for spatial and temporal feature extraction, respectively. By replacing the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism in ViT with CBAM, we significantly reduce the number of parameters and computational costs while enhancing the model's ability to focus on localized patterns essential for violence detection.
